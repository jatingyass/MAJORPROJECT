Repository Description: Airbnb Website Clone Project

Welcome to the Airbnb Website Clone project repository! This full-stack web application is built using Express, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MongoDB, incorporating various features and technologies for a robust and feature-rich experience.

## Project Overview

This project is an attempt to replicate the functionality and design of Airbnb, offering users a platform to search for, book, and manage accommodations. It demonstrates the implementation of various web development concepts and technologies, including:

- **Express & Node.js**: The backend is built on the Express framework, utilizing Node.js for server-side operations.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: The frontend is constructed with HTML, styled with CSS, and enhanced with JavaScript for dynamic interactions and user experience.
- **MongoDB**: Data is stored and managed using MongoDB, a NoSQL database, with schema definitions and models for structured data storage.
- **MVC Architecture**: The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to separate concerns and maintain a structured codebase.
- **Bootstrap**: The frontend design is built with Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing layout.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: User registration and login functionality are implemented using Passport.js for secure and authorized access.
- **Middleware**: Middleware functions are employed to handle requests, enhance security, and provide a smooth user experience.
- **Routing**: Various routes are established to navigate through different sections of the application.
- **EJS Templates**: Views are created using the EJS templating engine for dynamic rendering.
- **Environment Variables (.env)**: Sensitive data and configuration settings are stored in environment variables to enhance security.
- **Cloud Configuration**: MongoDB Atlas is used to host the database in the cloud for scalability and reliability.
- **Hashing**: User passwords are securely hashed to protect user data.
